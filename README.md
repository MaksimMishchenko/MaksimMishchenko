# 👋 Hi, I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer

🚀 Senior Frontend Developer specializing in **Angular**, **TypeScript**, and **state management at scale**.  
I focus on performance, clean architecture, and building maintainable large applications.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **NgRx** (devtools, memoized selectors, ngrx-data)
- **TypeScript** (advanced types, type-safe APIs)
- **Nx Monorepos**
- **Jest**

## 🏗 What I Care About
- Scalable frontend architecture
- Performance optimization & bundle size reduction
- Secure JWT-based auth & XSS prevention
- Clear dependency management & edge-case analysis

## 🌍 Currently Exploring
- Backend fundamentals & system design
- Microservices (REST, gRPC, events, WebSockets)
- Web security & authorization

## 🧪 Real-world Experience
- Large Angular apps
- Crypto exchange platforms (trading, KYC, portfolio)
- Error monitoring with Splunk

📫 Open to discussions about Angular, architecture, and TypeScript mastery
